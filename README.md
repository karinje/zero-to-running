# Zero-to-Running Developer Environment

**One command to rule them all: `make dev`**

A Docker-based development environment that gets you from zero to a fully running multi-service application stack in under 10 minutes. No manual configuration, no version conflicts, no "works on my machine" problems.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd zero-to-running

# 2. Copy environment configuration
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Start everything
make dev
```

That's it! Your environment is now running.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop** 24.0+ installed and running
- **Git** installed
- **8GB RAM** minimum (16GB recommended)
- **20GB free disk space**
- **Internet connection** (for first-time image downloads)

## 🏗️ What's Running

Once you run `make dev`, you'll have:

- **Frontend**: React app with Vite at http://localhost:3000
  - Hot reload enabled for instant code changes
  - Connects to backend API automatically
  - Modern React 18 with React Router
- **Backend**: Node.js API at http://localhost:4000
  - Express server with health endpoints
  - Connected to PostgreSQL and Redis
  - Hot reload enabled for development
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15.2 at localhost:5432
  - User: `wander_user`
  - Database: `wander_dev`
  - Each developer gets their own isolated database (no shared connections)
- **Cache**: Redis 7.0.5 at localhost:6379
  - Password: `dev_redis_password` (configurable in `.env`)
  - Isolated cache instance per developer

All services are containerized, isolated, and communicate via Docker networks.

## 🛠️ Common Commands

```bash
make dev          # Start all services
make down         # Stop all services
make clean        # Remove all data and volumes
make logs         # View all service logs
make health       # Check service health status
make help         # Show all available commands
```
